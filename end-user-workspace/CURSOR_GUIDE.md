## 🔍 Example Cursor Conversations

### **Setting Up Proxmox Connection**
**You:** "I need to configure the Proxmox connection. What should I put for the host IP?"
**Cursor:** "The Proxmox host IP is the IP address of your Proxmox server. You can find this by:
1. Logging into your Proxmox web interface
2. Looking at the URL in your browser (e.g., https://192.168.1.100:8006)
3. Or checking your network configuration

What's the IP address you use to access Proxmox?"

### **Configuring Network Settings**
**You:** "I'm not sure what subnet to use. My network uses 192.168.1.x addresses."
**Cursor:** "Based on your network using 192.168.1.x addresses, you should use:
- Network Gateway: 192.168.1.1 (usually your router)
- Network Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24 (covers 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254)

This is a common home/office network configuration. Does this match your setup?"

### **Deploying Infrastructure**
**You:** "Now help me deploy the infrastructure"
**Cursor:** "I'll deploy the AI infrastructure for you. This will:
1. Validate your configuration
2. Test the Proxmox connection
3. Create LXC containers
4. Set up LibreChat and MCP server
5. Configure networking

Let me start the deployment with 'make deploy'..."
